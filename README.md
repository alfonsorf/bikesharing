# Bikesharing with Tableau

## Overview 
The purpose of this week's challenge was to create an analysis of the CitiBike ride data for NYC and use the data to put together a proposal for potential investors to back a bikesharing company in Des Moines, Iowa. This challenge was not as heavy on coding, but it was about visualizing the data in sleek charts and learning how to use Tableau's features to make them.

## Summary
To conclude this analysis, based on the results the largest population that uses CitiBike are male, they are used mainly around commuting times (8 a.m. and 5-7 p.m.), and the average ride time on the bikes is 5 minutes. Based on these results and NYC demographics, it is likely most of the people who use them are local employees on their commute to work, with tourists using them during their visits. 
In NYC the CitiBike system has been very successful, but Des Moines, Iowa is a much smaller city based on population. In order to make a more informed decision I would suggest comparing the population density for both cities and include tourism in this analysis if possible, given that NYC is one of the most visited cities in the world. My second suggestion would be to analyze the cost of bike repairs and how often they are required, since this could possibly be one of the biggest expenses for the company.
